    <h1>In Reflection to the Fireside Chat</h1>
    <h3>Main Points</h3>
    <p> (I didn't know there were actual questions I hope these general reflections are ok)
    <ul>
      <li>Work load</li>
      <p>Karim talked several times about the immense work load that the bootcamp presents. At one point he even recommends that we give a letter to our family and friends to say that we will be unavailable for the next 9 weeks. This got me quite worried about my ability to commit so fully but also excited me because I am excited to push myself to my very limit</p>
      <li>Natural Ability</li>
      <p>At one point a viewer asks him about the importance of IQ in applicants ability to code, he pinned it at around 5%. I found this surprising but encouraging and it motivated me to study as much as possible</p>
      <li>Soft Skills</li>
      <p>When Karim talked about the importance of soft skills in finding a job I found it very interesting. Before starting this course I still had the stupid idea in my head that software development was a job which help relitively low value on communication skills due to the stereotypes in my head about people who work in tech. I know see this to be obviously ridiculous and I'm happy about it because I consider myself to be a social person and increase those team work skills is something which will benifit me as a person as well as help me find a job.
