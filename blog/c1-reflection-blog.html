           <h3>Work Load</h3>
           <p>Karim talked several times about the immense work load that the bootcamp presents. At one point he even recommends that we give a letter to our family and friends to say that we will be unavailable for the next 9 weeks. This got me quite worried about my ability to commit so fully but also excited me because I am excited to push myself to my very limit.</p>

          <h3>Narutal Ability</h3>
           <p>At one point a viewer asks him about the importance of IQ in applicants ability to code, he pinned it at around 5%. I found this surprising but encouraging and it motivated me to study as much as possible</p>

            <h3>Soft Skills</h3>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="six columns">
          <p>When Karim talked about the importance of soft skills in finding a job I found it very interesting. Before starting this course I still had the stupid idea in my head that software development was a job which help relitively low value on communication skills due to the stereotypes in my head about people who work in tech.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="six columns">
          <p>I know see this to be obviously ridiculous and I'm happy about it because I consider myself to be a social person and increase those team work skills is something which will benifit me as a person as well as help me find a job.</p>
