           <h3>What learnings did you take from this chapter?</h3>
          <p>Alot, I must admit I am slightly put off by the constant praise towards google and the just as constant padering towards engineers, I've tried reading similar kinds of books and the deifying of certian people always puts me off. Apart from that though this first chapter was great and a couple points definately resinated.</p>
          <h5>Identifying Emotions</h5>
          <p> I like this idea and will try to start encorporating it into my headspace, I can definitely tend to get swept away in the emotions without first identifying them.</p>
          <h5>Happiness as a Default State</h5>
          <p> While I am absolutely happy when good things happen, I identified with the issue that my default state is certiantly not happiness. I am usually in a state of slight anxiety and litteral hunger. I think this means I could do well from reading this book and also eating more. </p>

            <h3>How did you find the mindfullness meditation?</h3>
            <p>I liked it, I was sitting on a bean bag so there was lots of movement to distract me but once I started breathing deeply I was able to be very present. </p>
