           <h3>My emotional triggers (while programming)</h3>
           <p>In the last excerise I found that when stuck deeply in a block, I thought that I was far more without hope than I was. Because the path wasn't particularly clear I assumed I was drastically far off, which wasn't true. Once I started speaking myself through the processes I realized I could understand the excersize fairly well. The block wasn't even really real.</p>

          <h3>How I found the Siberian Highway Strategy</h3>
           <p>I like to think I stop and think before doing things but I often don't. I certianly get triggered and fall into pre-proggramed responses which aren't always the correct move. I think this strategy is sound.</p>
