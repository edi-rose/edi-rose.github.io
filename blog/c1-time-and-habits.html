<!--Question 1 and 2-->
       <div class="row">
         <div class="six columns">
           <h3>Which of the TimeBox habits did you try?</h3>
           <p>As of yet I haven't made any concious effort to try a technique because I have just been working when I can. I find that when I'm working well it is enjoyable for me to work for long periods of time in flow and then to take a long break.</p>
         </div>
         <div class="six columns">
          <h3>What did you find interesting?</h3>
           <p>I found the flow wiki to be really interesting as it's something we've all experienced but perhaps not conciously considered. I'd like to become more aware in how I can achieve and sustain flow as it is obviouly a very prefered state.</p>

<!--Question 3 and 4 -->
        <div class="row">
          <div class="six columns">
            <h3>What worked for you?</h3>
            <p>I have dabbled in meditation for short periods and it really helped with focus and was super calming. It's hard to commit to doing it for 20-40 minutes a day but I think I might start waking up earlier in order to do it.</p>

          <div class="six columns">
            <h3>Which techniques did you try?</h3>
              <p>As I mentioned I thik I will start trying to meditate and start small habits for myself. I also want to try the pomodoro technique although I'm not sure it's for me.</p>
