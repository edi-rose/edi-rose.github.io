    <h3>Quick Bit About My Favorite Resource </h3
    <h2>BJ Frogg</h2>
    <p>BJ Frogg's talk was a about the power of tiny habits and how they affect your life. He says there are three things which have to come together to change a habit.
      <ol>
        <li>Motivation</li>
        <li>Trigger</li>
        <li>Ability</li>
      </ol>
      <p> I found this very helpful and it allowed me to think about my own life and why I am able to do certian things and unable to persevere with other things. I am going to try start engineering certian productive habits in my own routine.
        <h2> Which Timebox habits did you try?</h2>
          <p> As of yet I haven't made any concious effort to try a technique because I have just been working when I can. I find that when I'm working well it is enjoyable for me to work for long periods of time in flow and then to take a long break.<p>
            <p> I intend of trying the popular pomodoro technique in the future.</p>
            <h2>What did you find interesting?</h2>
            <p> I found the flow wiki to be really interesting as it's something we've all experienced but perhaps not conciously considered. I'd like to become more aware in how I can achieve and sustain flow as it is obviouly a very prefered state.</p>
          <h2>What Worked for you?</h2>
          <p>I have dabbled in meditation for short periods and it really helped with focus and was super calming. It's hard to commit to doing it for 20-40 minutes a day but I think I might start waking up earlier in order to do it.</p>
          <h2>Which Will You Experiment with Further?<h2>
            <p>As I mentioned I thik I will start trying to meditate and start small habits for myself. I also want to try the pomodoro technique although I'm not sure it's for me.</p>
