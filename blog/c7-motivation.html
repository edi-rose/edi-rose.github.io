           <h3>How does life look through the : "Pleasure", "Passion" and "Purpose" lense?</h3>
           <p>I've definitely been too focused on pleasure this second half of the year. I am happy that bootcamp is starting soon. Hopefully it will give me the definitive and difficult goal I'm looking for. This idea seems pretty solid. I'd see no reason to doubt that happiness can be built off these princaples. </p>

          <h3>What are my Core Values?</h3>
           <p>Kindness, I'd say the most common ethical question I am regularly posed with is whether to be kind or how to be kind. My dad once said he wouldn't really care if I got in trouble at school as long as I never bullied anyone.

           Ambitiousness. I have a fear of giving up on dreaming. As a kid I placed goals for myself so high. Although now I realize I don't actually want to be a rockstar, I also don't want to give up my ability to dream. I think that with out limited lives the only logical thing to do is aim as high as you can dare to.

           Right and wrong. I don't think there is an objective morallity, but I think it'd be foolish to not act like there is. Because of that, I think we must be constantly trying to be a force for good, obviously the world isn't simple but if we stop checking our behaviour we start to lose a grip on reality.

            <h3>How did you find the other ideas?</h3>
            <p>I loved the excerise about predicting your future. It's such a powerful tool and it's also just fun to be optomistic and set high goals and posibilities..</p>
