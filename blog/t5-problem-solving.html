<!--Question 1 and 2-->
       <div class="row">
         <h1>Story Time</h1>

       <div class="row">
         <div class="six columns">
           <p>In sprint-2 I was stuck trying to organise my site in a way that I liked. I wanted to set up boxes on top of eachother with an image on the left-side and a text ox on the right but since I was very inexperienced with CSS and was not using a frame work this was proving difficult.</p>
         </div>
         <div class="six columns">
           <p>I started by trying to place all the boxes one by one by manipulating their borders. It was a nightmare and I was creating not dry or 'wet' (is that a thing) code.</p>
         </div>
         </div>

<!--Question 3 and 4 -->
        <div class="row">
          <div class="six columns">
            <p>I spent a long time placing all the images in their boxes and resizing them but it still didn't have a nice clean look. I took time off and thought about it for a while, after that I realized that I could generalize my divs more, simplifying the code and greatly improving the look becuase of the uniformity it produced.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="six columns">
            <p>I felt happy when it was over, especially because it wasn't something I was taught directly and I felt like a real front end developer! It taught me about how to generalize my css and html better and made me feel more confident about re-working my code even if something already kinda works</p>

          <h4>Pseudo Code</h4>
          <p>I have read quite a bit of pseudocode during my learning of JS and as a way to illustrate the DOM. I find it a useful tool.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="four columns">
          <h4>Trying something</h4>
          <p>I am very confident when it comes to trying new things, I am happy with my ability to retain my skills so it makes me feel good about learning more.</p>

          <h4>Rubber Ducky</h4>
          <p>I actually completely forgot about this method before it was brought up here but I want to try it as it's hilarious and I bet it's helpful. I do a similar technique by simply reading out the complicated text outloud in order to make sure I'm understanding each word.</p>

          <h3>Error Messages</h3>

        <div class="four columns">
          <h3>Console.log</h3>
          <p>I use console.log a lot but I've recently discovered debugging which I think will take over becuase of it's amazing functionality.</p>

        <div class="four columns">
          <h3>Googling</h3>
          <p> I almost always use google as my first means of troubleshooting. It is extremely useful and I usually opt for a youtube video for my simple questions.</p>

          <p>I usually opt for asking the Phase_0 chat for help if the block persists and I find it very comfortable and helpful, Guy is especially helpful.</p>

          <h3>Reflection</h3>
          <p>I have been making a very large effort to manage my time better and this has been largely a result of my reflection. I have bought a daily planner and set goals for the next day every night.</p>
