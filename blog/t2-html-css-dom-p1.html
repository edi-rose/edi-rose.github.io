        <h2>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h2>
        <p>The house analogy, HTML is the building frame and foundations, css is everthing you put inside the house, and I guess DOM is the way you present your plans to your builder/interior desginer.</p>

        <h2>What is the box model?</h2>
        <p>The box model is the format that divs are presented in the browser. They start with all the content which is inside a box and then contain all the padding and margins which control the area the div takes up.</p>
