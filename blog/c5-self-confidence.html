           <h3>What is the relationship between Mindfullness and Self-awareness</h3>
           <p>They're pretty much the same thing. Mindfullness is being aware of your state in an instance. Self-awareness is knowing about your state in the world throughout a day.</p>

          <h3>Journalling</h3>
           <p>I found writing down my weaknesses vs strengths was a helpful way of attempting to honestly asses myself which is a tricky thing to do as you have to disregard ego. I think it was helpful and interesting. Definitaly a calming experience.</p>

<!--Question 3 and 4 -->
        <div class="row">
          <div class="six columns">
            <h3>I am not my Emotions</h3>
            <p>I think it's a very profound statement. It is an idea which is very hopeful as it describes a reality in which one isn't a slave to their emotions but a seperate individual, capable of controlling your state over your fleeting emotions.</p>
